AI's 70% 
# Understanding the Code is Key
"The really big difference is that you are keeping the human engineer firmly in control. You are responsible for thinking about architecture, reviewing the code, understanding every line. You have to make sure you're understanding what AI is generating for you, so you are on the hook for making sure the final product is secure, scalable, maintainable." — Addy Osmani

"AI is a tool. If your name is on there, when that code is getting submitted, you are responsible for what you submitted. So you need to make sure that you're reviewing it." — Addy Osmani

# Reality Check on Productivity
"Often on Twitter, when we see people citing these very high percentage numbers about their productivity gains, if you zoom in, often those are companies that are doing greenfield development on something completely fresh. They don't have technical debt, they don't have all of the baggage that usually comes with traditional software engineering on something that is real and has existed for a while." — Addy Osmani

"Developer productivity is 1X, 2X. Maybe they can complete 20% more tasks than they could before. But we're also starting to see side effects. We're actually starting to see that code review is becoming the new bottleneck." — Addy Osmani

# Advice for Junior Developers
"It is in fact really, really motivating to be able to do whatever is gonna help you build something quickly. Make sure you are going back and actually taking the time to understand what it is that was being generated." — Addy Osmani

"Be curious. Use AI as a learning aid while still improving your motivation, your feeling about yourself building stuff." — Addy Osmani

"Five years ago, we would still see lots of people at every level going to Stack Overflow and in some cases just blindly copying whatever's been most voted as the solution for a problem. Was it actually the right solution? We learn years later, like, oh wait, how did I ship this to production? There are better ways of doing it. So it's okay to be imperfect just as long as you continue to be curious and are open to learning." — Addy Osmani
